This is a Tip Calculator application for iOS submitted as the pre-assignment requirement for Codepath.

Time spent: 2 hours

Completed:

 Required: User can enter a bill amount, choose a tip percentage, and see the tip and total values.
 Required: Settings page to change the default tip percentage.

Notes:
I did not spend any time making the app look right in other screen sizes and Landscape orientation.
